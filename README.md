# **Embedded Systems Projects**  

This repository showcases the projects I developed during my **Embedded Systems Diploma**, focusing on real-world applications using the **ATmega32 microcontroller**. The projects were built using **Eclipse IDE** for coding and **Proteus** for circuit simulation and validation.  

## **Projects Overview**  

1. **Stopwatch System**  
   - A digital stopwatch implemented using the ATmega32 microcontroller and a 7-segment display.  
   - Features accurate time tracking with start, stop, and reset functionality.  

2. **Fan Speed Controller with Temperature Control**  
   - A system that adjusts fan speed based on ambient temperature, using the ATmega32 and an LM35 temperature sensor.  
   - Includes PWM control for smooth speed variation.  

3. **Distance Measuring System**  
   - Measures distance using an ultrasonic sensor integrated with the ATmega32 microcontroller.  
   - Outputs precise distance measurements on an LCD display.  

4. **Door Locker Security System**  
   - A secure door lock system controlled by a keypad and LCD, powered by the ATmega32.  
   - Features user authentication and access control with GPIO integration.  

## **Tools and Technologies Used**  
- **Microcontroller:** ATmega32  
- **Programming Language:** C  
- **IDE:** Eclipse  
- **Simulation Software:** Proteus  
- **Components:** 7-segment display, LM35 sensor, ultrasonic sensor, keypad, and LCD.
